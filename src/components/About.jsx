            I'm a product-focused full-stack developer with experience building complete workflows from idea to deployment. 
            My strength lies in backend fundamentals and API design, allowing me to create robust systems that power real-world business operations. 
            I'm comfortable owning features end-to-end, from database design to frontend implementation, ensuring seamless user experiences. 
            I'm particularly interested in startups, SaaS products, and remote opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful products 
            that solve real problems. My approach combines technical excellence with business understanding, delivering solutions that 
            are both technically sound and strategically valuable.
